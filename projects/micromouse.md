- Seamless Ad Insertion: Dynamic ad placements integrated without disrupting content flow.
- Real-Time Adaptability: Behavioral analytics processed continuously to adapt in-session ad recommendations.
- A/B Testing Framework: Built-in testing for ad position, frequency, and creative to validate effectiveness.

Product Management Contributions
- Market Research & Competitive Benchmarking: Identified market gaps vs. Hulu, YouTube, and Amazon Prime.
- Product Strategy & Vision: Defined MVP scope to include premium plan differentiation and high-yield ad segments.
- Agile Delivery: Worked with ML engineers, UX designers, and business stakeholders to run bi-weekly sprints.
- Stakeholder Alignment: Engaged advertising, marketing, and engineering teams for KPI definition and GTM planning.

Technology Stack

- Backend & Processing: MySQL, Pandas, Numpy, Python
- Deployment & Cloud: AWS, Docker
- Visualization: Power BI, matplotlib
- UX: Figma for wireframes and mockups

Milestones
- Phase 1: User data ingestion pipeline for behavioral capture.
- Phase 2: ML model development and training.
- Phase 3: Integration via REST APIs with Netflixâ€™s ad platform.
- Phase 4: A/B test launch and feedback loop.

Key KPIs
- 17% increase in click-through rates (CTR) on recommended ads.
- 22% boost in advertiser revenue from targeted ad slots.
