Overview
This system was developed to enhance the management of theater productions through the implementation of a relational database system, providing robust tools for handling complex data related to members, productions, and finances.

Key Features
- **Relational Database Design**: Designed and implemented a comprehensive relational database system using SQL Server, including ER diagrams and integrity constraints to maintain accurate data across multiple entities like members, productions, ticket sales, and financial records.
- **OLAP Mining Structures**: Utilized SQL Server Analysis Services and Microsoft Association Rules within SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to create OLAP mining structures and measures on Multidimensional Cubes for in-depth analysis of ticket sales, revenue, and other financial metrics.
- **Financial Tracking System**: Implemented a financial tracking system that monitors ticket sales, pricing strategies, and revenue generation for each production. This data-driven approach contributed to more effective budgeting, financial planning, and overall theater performance.

Tech Stack
- **Database**: SQL Server
- **OLAP Tools**: SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS), Microsoft Association Rules
- **Development Environment**: SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)

Key Milestones
- **Database Design**: Creation of ER diagrams and integrity constraints to support data relationships between productions, members, ticket sales, and finances.
- **OLAP Mining**: Built Multidimensional Cubes for analyzing financial performance across different productions and time periods, leading to optimized pricing strategies and financial planning.
- **Financial and Ticketing Integration**: Developed systems to track ticket sales and revenue for each production, providing actionable insights for optimizing budgets and improving future productions.

Key Insights Provided:
- **Ticket Sales Analysis**: Analysis of sales performance, ticket pricing, and revenue generation across different productions.
- **Revenue Tracking**: Comprehensive tracking of revenue streams and financial data, allowing for more informed financial planning.
- **Financial Planning**: Tools to support budgeting decisions based on real-time financial data.

Analysis
By implementing a structured relational database and OLAP system, this project significantly improved the accuracy and efficiency of financial management for the theater troupe. The system enabled better budgeting and planning processes, helping optimize production costs and enhance overall financial outcomes.
